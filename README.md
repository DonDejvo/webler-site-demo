# webler-site-demo <br />
This is a draft version of the Webler Group's official website. This website uses React as it's front-end library.<br />
<br />
<hr/><br />
<br />
Vite was used to create this React app, so running the app in "dev mode" and hot preview requires: <code>npm run dev</code> <br />.

Use <code>npm run build</code> to deploy production build, and <code>npm run preview</code> to preview the production build. <br />

There may be missing image in "dev mode" preview of react page, and this can be overcome by running the preview of the production build instead, as long as the <code>/dist</code> folder contains the folder <code>resources</code> and the required image files insde.
