# webler-site-demo <br />
This is a draft version of the Webler Group's official website. This website uses React as it's front-end library.<br />

Vite was used to create this React app, so running the app in "dev mode" and hot preview requires: <code>npm run dev</code> <br />.
I'm currently having issues with <code>npm run build</code>, where images are not displaying (probably due to src issues), however everything works fine in "dev mode".
