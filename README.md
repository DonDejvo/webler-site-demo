# webler-site-demo <br />
This is a draft version of the Webler Group's official website. This website uses React as it's front-end library.<br />
<br />
<hr/><br />
<br />
Vite was used to create this React app, so running the app in dev mode and hot preview requires: <code>npm run dev</code> <br />.
I'm currently having issues with <code>npm run build</code>, so I cannot get the deployment of the production build done right. Please help me with this issue. Thanks.
